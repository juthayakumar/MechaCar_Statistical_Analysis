In this distribution of data, we can see that the dataset is within normal limits. The p-value is above the assumed significance level, so there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

 - Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? Vehicle weight, spoiler angle and AWD provided non-random amount of variance.
 - Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? It is not considered to be zero because the p-value is less than 0.05.
 - Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? the r-squared value is 0.71, which means 71% of the predictions with be correct, showing us that this is an effective dataset.
